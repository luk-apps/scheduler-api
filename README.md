# Scheduler
Scheduler is an app that arranges your events in calendar automatically according to participants availabilities and given parameters. It's based on my original algorithm. It consists of Java REST api with MongoDB and Angular frontend ([repo](https://github.com/luk-apps/scheduler-client)).

The algorithm helps you creating schedules with the most optimal time for every participant. It also automatically adjusts them to the number of rooms you have at your disposal.

How it works?
1. Create participants and set up their availabilities in calendar
2. Create events and set their duration and participants
3. Provide additional parameters and generate schedule

## How to run?

You can run the app with docker:
```console
git clone https://github.com/luk-apps/scheduler-api.git
cd scheduler-api
docker-compose up
```
Then open [localhost:80](localhost:80). By default the app runs on port 80. You can change it in docker-compose.yml file if neccessary.
